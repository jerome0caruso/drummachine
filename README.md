# Drum Machine
JS drum machine- I have included two script files, script.js has some of my notes that helped me understanding what was going on, I have also included script1.js that does not have any notes.  In this exercise I learned about audio.play() and currentTime methods and using a loop to iterate over a nodeList, also helped me understand this and event more.
